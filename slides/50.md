## Prototypes

While it might seem like the convenient, even best thing to do,
the price is not for you, but for other people.

Best way to do it?

`Object.defineProperty`

Recommended to always include it like so:
```javascript
Object.defineProperty(my_obj, 'key3', {
  enumerable: false, // doesn't show up in "for(var in ...)"
  configurable: false, // can you go "delete my_obj.key3"
  writable: false, // can you go "my_obj.key3 = 'something'"
  value: 'static' // or a function, or nothing
});
```
